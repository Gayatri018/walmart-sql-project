## üß™ Approach & Methodology

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Wrangling

* Checked for null values (none due to `NOT NULL` constraints)
* Created and populated SQL tables from cleaned dataset

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering

Added new fields to enhance analysis:

* `time_of_day`: Categorized into **Morning**, **Afternoon**, **Evening**
* `day_name`: Extracted day of the week (Mon‚ÄìSun)
* `month_name`: Extracted month name for trend analysis

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed analysis using **SQL queries** to answer key business questions across product performance, customer behavior, and branch efficiency.
